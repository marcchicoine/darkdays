				The  mouth  of  the  tunnel  is  wide  
				and dark, swallowing the light and 
				all  that  breathes.  Rubble  is  scattered  along  the  train  tracks,  bordered by retaining walls covered in 
				numerous layers of graffiti.
				This is where it all started.
				  Here  by  the  parkway  with  
				the blasting trucks and the roaring 
				cars, near the filigree arches of the 
				Riverside  Drive  viaduct,  here  with  
				the gravel crunching under my feet
				as I run down the railroad into this 
				hollow mouth.
				 This is where they live, deep 
				into the depths of the city, way underground,  lying  in  the  dirt.  Sure,  
				you  know  about  them.  Of  course  
				you  know  about them. They’ve  always been there, resting low below 
				the  rowdy  streets  and  the  carving  
				avenues,  gulping  the  air  from  inside  the  earth,  crawling  through  
				holes and cracks, living off the grid 
				and off the books. Here in the tunnels.
				You’ve heard the rumors. Their eyes have adapted to the constant night that cloaks them from the topside world. Don’t you know they’re eating rats and human flesh? Don’t you know they want us dead?

	And one day they will spill outside and burn us all alive, and they will reign over our flat screen joys and our organic delights.
	Of course you know about them. The lost ones, the hidden ones. The broken and the ill, the wandering, the gone. The Mole People.
	Marc Singer’s Dark Days (2000) records the lives of several “homeless” people living in subway tunnels underneath New York City. As this documentary enters the “domesticated” underground, where those who have very little struggle to make a home, it traces the inhabitants’ lives using what we call a narrative of adaptation.
	We see little houses that have become homes with domestic comforts like electric lights, hot plates, and coffee pots. Like Flaherty’s subjects in films like Nanook of the North, Singer’s homeless have adapted the environment to meet their needs. But also like Flaherty, Singer shapes his subject romantically: He further transforms his subjects’ context both by physically altering it and by manipulating stories into a traditional narrative.

<h2 class="grid-content">
		Singer interviews subjects to reveal back stories, and they both build narratives out of individual tales of environmental compromise. To construct this narrative, Singer and his subjects create a world where the city is a dangerous place, a wilderness, and the homeless seek shelter where no one else will go. Singer and his subjects work together to alter the underground landscape to accommodate filmmaking, as well. Singer seems to have constructed this above-ground city as a “wilderness” the homeless must escape because they cannot tame it. And they only reenter this “wild” urban world to acquire subsistence. Below ground, however, domestic life flourishes in a world the homeless, according to Singer’s perspective, have adapted to serve their needs. 
	In this paper, we focus on the lives and stories of a number of the characters that Singer lived with and learned from, during his two year span underground. We discover how ingenious and adaptable this small shanty community was, and what their world view was like. We hear about trials and tribulations, tragedy, and new beginnings. Each person has a narrative...

				Ironically, the tunnel’s community support was in many ways more efficient than the one offered by municipal programs. In the encampment, the dwellers had a familiar place to be, watch TV, read or smoke. They had autonomy. Rules were simple but strictly enforced. Respect for privacy. No yelling. No stealing. No stupid behavior or you’d be kicked out. Some, like Isaac, were at home in the darkness, and would not have lived anywhere else.

						Most who lived here did not consider themselves homeless. In a 1990 Los Angeles Times article, Isaac explained that the small community lived as well, if not better, than the average people “up top,” as they commonly refer to the streets.
				“I’ve had the opportunity to get jobs,” he said. “I don’t choose to be a robot within the system… We’ve done something that one out of every 1,000 men in creation in their lifetimes will do. We dared to be ourselves.”

					Our first response, because of the long relationship we’ve had with our clients, was to immediately go to court. Previous to Amtrak’s decision to evict people out of the tunnel, we had just sued Amtrak on the grounds that they could not kick people out of Penn Station. So when we found out that Amtrak was gunna come in, we 
					immediately pushed a lawsuit because we knew we had to stop them from throwing people out of the tunnel, who had called it their home for ten, fifteen, twenty five years. We met first with Amtrak officials, who were at first very abrupt, they wanted everybody out. 			</h2>

				Had to be a few days, they were gunna fence it and put in security guards. So we worked out a plan, we were gunna assist people into moving into temporary shelter. And we worked out a plan to temporarily assist people. But soon thereafter we learned about a program led by the federal government, a Section-8 program. And we guaranteed Amtrak no one would be left in the tunnel. The Section-8 program, the housing program here in New York City, is a great ticket to housing. It guarantees someone an apartment, helps pay the brokers and the security fees. Its the perfect chance, and i think amtrak knew that.

						 New York’s homeless shelters are a lucrative business. The incentives paid by the Department of Homeless Services to landlords renting out shelter units far exceed the ones given for providing tenants with permanent single room occupancy lodging. In 2014, the average stay was 352 days at the Freedom House, a homeless shelter on West 95th Street managed by private company Aguila Inc. The city paid Aguila $3,735 per month for each 100-square-foot room occupied by a homeless person. Conditions are appalling inside the Freedom House. Garbage piles up in the courtyard for rodents to feed on. Aggressive panhandling, drug dealing and violent outbursts are commonplace in the shelter’s vicinity. Sometimes a TV is hurled out a window, or the police close the street after someone is stabbed in a fight.

						<span class="grid-size-1of3">
							<h2 class="grid-content"> 
						The NYPD regularly raids the place looking for people with outstanding warrants, targeting domestic abusers and failing to arrest the major dealers or car thieves roaming the area. “Why would anyone want to stay [at Freedom House]?” asks Jessica, a former resident. “I can’t count the times my stuff was stolen from me. One day I was assaulted in my own room and the guards didn’t do anything!” She adds, sitting on a rug in her new spot, inside a man-made cave near the Lincoln Tunnel entrance. Jessica was evicted from Freedom House in late 2014, after DHS came to an agreement with community boards and nonprofit organizations to cut the shelter’s capacity in two from 400 beds to 200 — a step toward its conversion to a meaningful permanent affordable housing facility. The 23-year-old knows enough about shelters. She will never go back. She was sixteen when she got pregnant with her daughter Alyssa.

						She briefly lived with the baby’s father until he tired of dealing with a needy toddler, leaving never to be seen again. Jessica was then diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and admitted to transitional housing in Brooklyn. She says that within a month, social services was badgering her to place her three-year-old in foster care. She says. “I was devastated. I called my sister and begged her to take care of Alyssa until I found a place of my own. This was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done in my life, leaving my baby. But it was the right thing to do. At least she is with family. When she grows up I will explain it all to her.” She looks away, tears rolling down her face.
Once her daughter was in the hands of her sister, Jessica was sent to the Freedom House where she stayed for seven months until Aguila notified her of her imminent relocation.

		She began sleeping in a subway tunnel after transit authorities made her leave her spot in the Herald Square station corridor on 34th Street, dragging her by her feet when she refused to stand up from her mat. “At first I was like ‘I’m never going down there.’ But then Hurricane Sandy came and I had no place to stay, and I didn’t want to go to a shelter again with all the crackheads.” She spent about two months living in a recess by the subway tracks of a Midtown station, protected from the elements and from harassment. She wrote a long letter to her daughter there. She never sent it. “I hope you think of me sometimes in your dreams,” the letter ends. “You are the light of my life. I miss you everyday.

					Jessica then moved to her current place, closer to the McDonald’s restaurant where she works.

				When Amtrak decided to reactivate the Riverside Park tunnel’s train tracks in 1991, about fifty residents were evicted from the shantytown and received vouchers for temporary housing. This first round of evictions wound up largely ineffective and the population 
				quickly grew back to its initial size, as people from up top encampments went straight to the tunnel when they were swept up by police during Mayor Giuliani’s effort to clean up the streets.
					The Empire Line trains rushing through didn’t stop them from coming down here. Amtrak Police Captain Doris Comb started calling for more enforcement, 
				effectively pushing the homeless out of the active railway. Different times were looming ahead. Safer times. Sterilized. Hygienic. “We try to offer the homeless a variety of social services,” Comb would 
				explain in 1994. “The problem is that most homeless are completely isolated. They feel rejected and 
				decline assistance.”

			   <span class="grid-size-1of3">
<h2 class="grid-content">
					Bernard Isaac still held a grudge against Comb eighteen years later, for having seized the #102 universal key to the exit gates an Amtrak employee had given him. “It was clear in my head that I didn’t want to go,” he told me in 2012, sipping a tea on the Hudson River Greenway. “We were ready to brick up the entrances if needed. We knew that we would have to leave eventually, but we didn’t want to accept it just yet.” 
					The tunnel residents weren’t quick to fill the multitude of forms requested by the Social Security Administration. Some flatly refused to cooperate and gave up all hope of being granted Section 8 apartments.
					In 1994, U.S. Secretary of Housing Henry Cisneros visited the dwellings and, realizing the 
				urgency of the situation, released 250 housing subsidy vouchers and a $9 million grant to help the squatters move to appropriate accommodations. Unfortunately, Department of Housing Preservation and Development policies

				 the Mole People were not considered “housing-ready” even though they had already created homes from nothing, complete with furniture and decorations. It wasn’t until Mary Brosnahan, director at the Coalition for the Homeless, negotiated with Amtrak to temporarily delay the evictions, that the vouchers were distributed to the tunnel community. The dwellers eventually received permanent housing, leaving the tunnel mostly empty for the first time since the mid-1970’s.
					Margaret Morton would later write in a 1995 New York 
				Times article that this solution had been by far the most economical for the city. “It costs more than $20,000 a year to keep a person in a cot on an armory floor,” she wrote. “It costs about $12,000 to keep that person in the kind of supported housing being made available to the tunnel people.”
